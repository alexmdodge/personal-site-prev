        	<p>As an educator, my primary goal is to give my students the opportunities and experiences I never had. My previous experiences weren't negative; I just want to give something different and unique, and to try my own ideas. The first thing I want to bring is my passion for my subjects, but also the passion I know I'll have for new ones. I hope that with excitement and dedication I can inspire my students to love learning like I do. Secondly I want to bring my love of technology to the classroom. We live in a constantly changing world, where technology is becoming ever more prevalent. I want to expose my students to everything I can, and show them how we can use technology responsibly and effectively. Finally, I want to give back to the educational community in a tangible way, through student initiatives, projects, and demonstrations. If find actually having physical examples at all levels of education are useful.
