        	<p> I am a frantically organized person, and in the deepest sense love every aspect of cleaning. I am an avid computer scientist. From building my own computer, to writing various programs in many languages, I find it an art of its own. I am extremely involved in the Lifesaving Society as well as swimming in general. I have been teaching swimming lessons, as well as higher level lifesaving courses for six years now, and I felt it strongly helped shaped my decision of taking education. I love adventure and travel, and plan to make it around the world many times in my life. Different cultures give us different perspectives, and give us a deeper understanding of our world. I am stubborn, which can sometimes be a negative quality, but most of the time results in my relentless effort to complete every task on my color coded checklists. I am actually writing a to-do list program at the moment. I love animals, as my dogs are my best friends, and are the best example of unwavering dedication and love. Lastly I have my family and my girlfriend. They have been the largest influence in my life. They are a group of people we always seem to underestimate but always surprise us, and to this day I wouldn't be where I am without them. They have shown me my strengths and weaknesses, and will no doubt continue to shape my opinions and decisions as a teacher. All of the features will no doubt contribute to my quirkiness in the classroom, and hopefully along the way will allow me to inspire and influence our future society.
