# Previous Versions of my Website

These versions are here for educational and inspirational purposes. Since the inception of the first website I built nearly four years ago, I've kept and logged all of the versions. I'm in the process of collecting the remaining fragments and arranging them so they can be built and run.

# Education

I would also like these pages to be used as examples of how my practice has developed and how technologies have grown over the past couple of years.

## Version 1
Built entirely with html and css, this site was my first forray into sprites. The sprites themselves actually look quite nice, and for a first attempt it wasn't all that bad. The other interactive piece was expandable photos.

## Version 2
Again another simple build. This was the first functional site with a wide range of pages and information. The highlight was the scrolling banner on the front page, which was some early stages of javascript learning.

## Version 3
The longest standing version of the site. This was the most detailed, and was the first time I had attempted creating a responsive design. It was only a couple of months ago I retired this site.

## Version 4
This was a holder page while I worked on the most recent update. I would have developed right from this version but there were too many changes to the directory and depencies that it was just easier to start fresh.

## Version 5
This is the current version of the site.
