        	<p> There have been many life experiences which have shaped my educational views, but they are generally focused around extremes. I have learned a lot from teachers which I felt did not provide the most positive experiences, as well as teachers who provided extremely positive experiences. <br><br>

In junior high school I had a teacher which taught me a lot about diversity. From her class I learned that everything you do as a teacher is watched and analysed. You have to be careful to avoid being prejudice, sexist, as well as any kind of discrimination against the LGBT community. I also learned that fairness, kindness, and community make a classroom. A lack of any of those can severely affect what your students think of you. My computer science teacher in high school taught me the importance, and the pleasure you can get from self-learning. This is something which I feel all students must have the opportunity to do, and something I want to give my students the chance to do. It gives students a chance to relate and explore their own world and connect it to the curriculum.<br><br>

Before this course started, I was a very intrigued with Sir Ken Robinson, and had seen many of his videos before. He is an incredibly large inspiration when I think of my own education, and what kind of education I want to provide to my students.
