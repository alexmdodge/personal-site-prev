        	<p> My life has been a typical one when it comes to education. I attended one elementary, junior high and high school, and then went to university. I never had much difficulty in school, particularly in science related subjects. When I reached high school, physics was my favourite subject, but close behind it was a computer programming elective I had taken. This elective ended up being my second major, and the means by which I've completed this project.<br><br>

In grade eleven, when I first took physics and computer science, I also experienced something I never had before. I was having difficulty with my courses, particularly in mathematics and physics. I had encountered material which didn't come easily, and required a determination and practice to do well in. I think this is where my educational life changed, and I began to think about education differently. If it had of been a subject I was not as interested in I may not have stuck with it, but I found physics so fascinating that I persevered. I would consider this a moment where I realized that in order to not only do well, but appreciate what I was learning, I had to apply myself and work hard. <br><br>

When I made it to university, I developed and even deeper appreciation for learning, and very quickly discovered what it was like to teach others. I became a high school and university tutor, as well as a lab assistant. I also threw myself into each of my subjects, as everything was more specific, and it was all exactly what I loved to do. The final piece to the puzzle was the guidance my professors gave me, and the model and inspiration they provided in and out of the courses. All together these defined my education, and my love of learning. </p>
