        	<p> When I was in grade eight, my science teacher told me that I was going to be a teacher one day. I was angry, and at the time had a solid idea of what I wanted to do when I was older. Of course this changed multiple times, and before I knew it I found myself at the end of second year contemplating where I wanted to go after university. I questioned whether I should go to NSCC after, travel, go try to find a programming job, or continue and do my honours then masters.<br><br>

At this point in university I was working as a high school and university tutor, teaching assistant, swim instructor, and smile instructor. I was so frustrated because I enjoyed all of the topics so much, I couldn't just pick one. Then it hit me. I had been putting it out of my mind, almost subconsciously telling myself I would never do it, but it was there all along. I knew that I was already a teacher, and becoming a school teacher will just become the next step. Looking back I find myself laughing at having not considered it first.
