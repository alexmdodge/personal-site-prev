        <div class="intro">
            <p> My teaching style is built on a three tier system, which covers all aspects of a
            classroom, school, and community of learners. My belief is that teaching should be
            child centered, incorporate diversity, and inspire true motivation.</p>
        </div>
		
        <div class="main">
    	<p id="cont1"> <b>Student-Centered</b> <br> This tier covers many aspects in the classroom. First
    		and foremost it means that a youth's needs come first. This includes every student in
    		every class. Whether that student has a disability, trouble with a subject, or is
    		experiencing difficulty in some other way, their needs come first and I will dedicate
    		time to help them in whatever capacity I can. Youth cannot learn without their basic 
    		needs met. Secondly, this means that students must be given an opportunity to interact
    		in the class, and are repeatedly asked why. If we don't question students, they leave
    		school believing their is nothing in society to question, and therefore nothing to change.
    		Finally this also means that students must help derive the curriculum in some way. This
    		means including self-study topics, open projects, and goal setting. Giving students the
    		agency to direct their learning not only inspires strong creative content, but also
    		encourages a strong collaboration of cross-curricular material.</p>

    		<p id="cont2"> <b>Diverse Classrooms</b> <br> This tier involves themes of community, society,
    		culture, religion, inclusion, and collaboration. The most important thing you can
    		teach a child is that as much as life can be competitive, the most powerful creations
    		come about from a team effort. Teaching students about the connection to their local
    		and global community allows them to place themselves in the context of the world, and
    		obtain a much larger perspective in terms of their global opinions. I believe a class
    		which promotes equality over neutrality is key. Everyone's religions, cultures, and
    		societies should be respected and treated as equal, but at the same time compromise
    		is necessary in a truly multicultural setting. Instead of pinning students against each
    		other it is essential to pose class wide, community wide, and global goals. The sense
    		of accomplishment a group of students get from true collaboration and friendship is the
    		most powerful reinforcement in teaching.</p>
    		<img class="cont-phil" id="img1" alt="Diverse Classrooms" src="images/group.png" />
    		
    		<p id="cont3"> <b>True Motivation</b> <br> Too often when I think back to high school, I found myself
    		questioning why I was learning certain subjects. Looking back I can now see why I learned
    		some things but not others. At the time I was lost, and if certain teachers had given a 
    		more concrete application, real life connection, or legitimate reason behind the content,
    		I would have been more strongly motivated. When teaching a subject its not just as easy
    		to say you must learn it. If a curriculum includes something, it has been put there for
    		a reason and it is the responsibility of the teacher to reveal those reasons. It should
    		not be a secret to your students. Practical explanation, application, and practice are key
    		when teaching any subject. Even if a theory is abstract, or doesn't have any near future
    		uses, you must stress the importance of what it could lead to later on. I believe that
    		demonstration is another powerful tool to help students in the path of learning. I aim
    		to provide a rich curriculum which not only teach theoretical content, but also shows
    		the practical application of it as well.</p>
