            <b>Welcome</b> to my online portfolio! I have done my best to
    		reliably create and organize all the information on this site.
    		If anything is out of place, or something is not working, please
    		leave me a message through the contact page. <br><br>
    		
    		<b>Teaching</b> is something that I have always done, and plan to do
    		for the rest of my life. When I was young I had a habit of trying
    		to help my siblings with everything in their life. I loved working
    		with my friends to solve problems, and I could almost always be
    		found with a pile of Lego in my lap. Swimming has always been
    		an avenue of growth for me. I started swimming lessons when I was
    		young, and moved on to take higher level lifesaving courses. I
    		eventually became a swim instructor and lifeguard. I loved teaching
    		swimming lessons, and still teach from time to time. Eventually
    		upon reaching university I started to tutor, helped with first year
            physics classes, and obtained certifications to teach lifeguards.<br><br>
    		
    		<b>I attended</b> Acadia University for my undergraduate degree, and
    		finished with a double major in physics and computer science.
    		Typically the field path for either of these degrees is to take
    		an honours option, and then continue to a masters degree. The
    		problem was, I just wasn't satisfied with that idea. When I was 
    		deciding about what I wanted to do, I couldn't settle on a specific
    		field. I just loved it all too much. That's when it started to
    		dawn on me that there was so much to learn, I never wanted to
    		stop. I wanted to share, I wanted to explore, I wanted to teach. 
            <br><br>

            <b>I currently</b> have teachables in physics and math with methods courses
            in technology education. I have a deep passion for technology, and in
            all of my classes I will work to integrate technology effectively into
            the classroom. The most important thing about technology is understanding
            when it should be used. If there is an instance where a pencil and paper
            would be more appropriate, then its best to use that. Forcing technology
            results in misuse. <br><br>

            <b>In my spare</b> time I love to swim, program, travel, and cook. Travelling is
            one of my other passions. I've been across Canada, around the US, across
            the pond to the British Isles and France, and down to Africa. I consider
            myself very lucky in that I've had the opportunity to see all of these
            places. Travel gives you the chance to see and experience another culture.
            This is so incredibly important because it helps to break the bubble we
            all inevitibaly live in, being in one place for so long. I've found that
            travel has helped to define my belief of community, and allowed me to
            appreciate everything in my life more and more. <br><br>

            I hope this site is found to be informative and useful. I end this blurb
            with one of my favorite quotes. <i> "Live as if you were to die tomorrow,
            learn as if you were to live forever." <b>- Mahatma  Gandhi</b></i>
