                <h3 id="title-1">07/03/2014 - First Day of Class</h3>
                <p id="info-1"> To say I was excited for this course is an
                understatment.
                I believe that technology is an incredibly important part of
                society, and it is only going to become more prevalent as time
                goes on. When I was first reading the course outline I was
                very excited by the fact that I would have the opportunity to
                develop my professional profile. I love graphic design, web
                design, document preparation, and a host of other technologies.
                I look forward to using all these skills to hep forward my
                own goal of becoming a teacher.<br><br>
                
                Today in class we talked about the various technologies we
                would use throughout the course. I took a survey which helped
                outline my knowledge surrounding different pieces of software.
                I think in this course I will place focus on the online markup
                software, as this has the greatest potential for interactive
                programming you could do as a class. These include programs
                like google documents, and office online. I look forward to
                tomorrow's lesson, where we will start to look into our web
                pages.
                </p>

            <div class="entry-2">
                <h3 id="title-2">07/04/2014 - Up and Running</h3>
                <p id="info-2"> We started today by re-capping the information
                from yesterday, as well as getting into our groups and
                discussing topics for our presentations. The group I am a part
                of decided to focus on interactive technologies. The idea
                I had was surrounding motioni capture and virtual reality based
                hardware. It would be incredible to give your students a tour
                of the ISS like they were actually there, or show them the
                Grand Canyon first hand. There are limitless capabilities with
                technology, and we just have to decide where best to put it
                in an education setting.<br><br>
                
                Afterwards we had a brief introduction to google sites, and
                were sent on our ways. Initially I was open to the idea of
                using google sites, but soon realized it was failry limited
                in terms of its features. The most powerful web hosting/design
                site I'm aware of is wordpress. I think having the general
                populace versed or at least aware of web design aspects is so
                critical, because everything is online nowadays. When everyone
                knows this basic knowledge, the quality, content, and security
                of online content becomes monumentally better. In the end I
                decided to take a custome design approach, as I had many ideas
                which I was not able to convey in the google sites application.

            <div class="entry-3">
                <h3 id="title-3">07/05/2014 - Introduction to Graphic
                Organizers</h3>
                <p id="info-3"> We began today by reviewing what we have done
                in our groups to this point. We have decided to do interactive
                classroom technologies as mentioned in the previous entry.
                We then reviewed some individual ePortfolio's of my fellow
                classmates. Some of the google sites pages looked quite good!
                We then lookedin uploading techniques for our resume's and
                collected works. For my portfolio, to reduce the size of the
                content I have stored on online servers, I'll reference links
                to my dropbox which will have dedicated sections for content.
                Overtime I hope to integrate bloggin software, as well as some
                javascript and videos into my site. <br><br>
                
                For the remainder of the class we looked into the graphic
                organizing software Inspiration, as well as other free to use
                software. I was testing the online application called
                Webspiration. From my use of the software before, and the 
                prelimary testing of the online version, my preferred software
                of choice is an open source program known as Dia. This has
                many of the same options, but in some ways is better, as it
                has many add-ons freely available for download. It also works
                with Linux based operating systems. I believe one of my
                educational goals will be to help linux based OS make its way
                into the schooling system a bit more. At time it can be
                troublesome, but it gives a whole other level of understanding
                to those with the patience to try it.

        <div class="entry-4">
                <h3 id="title-4">07/07/2014 - Hurrican Surprise</h3>
                <p id="info-4"> Well the hurricane certainly made this an interesting
                weekend, but I'm lucky in the fact that my power came back on Sunday. Today,
                due to the cancellation, I worked on the online assignments designated for
                the online class day. I now realize that having a class like this can
                be extremely useful. I know that you can't just give students a day off
                in public school to go work at home, but the idea of always planning for
                school cancellations is such an important idea. Because of that extra class,
                we were able to recover from the day off, and continue the course as planned
                without a hitch. Backup planning in education seems essential. Always having
                just that little bit extra to do allows you so much more flexibility in your
                lessons, no matter what goes wrong. I think a good way to account for days
                off is have pieces of lessons that even each day can be cut out if necessary,
                to help catch up. This could be a quick reflection at the end of class, or some
                other piece which has its place, but can be substituted if necessary.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="entry-5">
                <h3 id="title-5">07/08/2014 - Stop Motion Video Creation</h3>
                <p id="info-5"> Today we created stop motion videos using cameras, and whatever
                else we could get out hands on. We ended up creating a paper animation with
                some random toys each of us brought in. The activity was a lot of fun, and let
                us experiment with our cameras, and the stock video software provided on our
                computers. <br><br>
                
                The most important thing I took away from this activity is giving students a
                chance to let their creativity shine. We had three and a half hours to work
                on our projects, and we may have a bit experience in terms of creation, but
                by spreading this activity over a couple of classes it would be incredible to
                see what students would come up with. Giving youth the ability to direct their
                own learning by drawing on their own knowledge and interests makes the whole
                process so much more rich and exciting. The end products are also much higher
                quality because the students feel what they've created has more personal value.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="entry-6">
                <h3 id="title-6">07/09/2014 - Open Workshop Project</h3>
                <p id="info-6"> Today was focused around finishing any outstanding assignments
                as well as working on our group projects for the final class. One thing I was
                initially dreading, but have come to love, are all the group presentations
                we've done so far. <br><br>
                
                Today was another good example of a class where it's student directed. During these
                days you can simply leave students with something to work on, whether it be
                assigned work, or a self-directed project, and it gives them a chance to reflect
                a bit more on what they're working on, as well as determining where each
                student in the class is. Inidividual and group work is so important because
                it is transactional learning where students are given the opportunity to 
                communicate their own ideas, instead of being presented someone elses. Asking
                a student why is certainly one of my central beliefs in the category of student
                centered learning.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="entry-7">
                <h3 id="title-7">07/10/2014 - Copyright Introduction</h3>
                <p id="info-7"> I was particularly excited to have this class. As a aspiring
                web designer, information property is a very touchy subject, and I needed some
                sort of introduction. I looked on the internet for information but I was never
                one hundred percent of what I was reading. I think I have a much better grasp
                now on what copyright is, and feel comfortable in how this pertains to my own
                personal work, and work that I use from other sources. <br><br>
                
                I liked the format of this class because it required us to not only learn the
                material but also apply it immediately in the context of our classroom. This is
                another tier of my philosophy, which is practical application. A concept will not
                stick with a student unless they know why they're learning it, where to use it,
                or where it will be used eventually. As the saying goes, practice makes perfect,
                and you can never just deliver a topic to a student and expect them to remember
                it the first time.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="entry-8">
                <h3 id="title-8">07/11/2014 - Instructional Technology Presentation </h3>
                <p id="info-8"> Today was the first of the three IT presentation groups.
                The goal of these groups was to collaborate, collect, and present information on
                technology concerning education. This is another incredibly powerful teaching
                method. As a teacher you are one mind, and while you may have access and knowledge
                of a greater number of resources, you don't have access to more creativity or
                inovation. This is where self-directed and group collaboration work so well, and
                can enrich not only your curriculum, but teach their peers something as well.
                <br><br>
                
                Of all the presentations today I felt the most useful was technology tools for
                the classroom. It is good to talk about issues, but once you understand them,
                repeating similar arugments over and over does little to provide new information.
                This group provided helpful applications and resources one might use in their
                class for presentations, modelling, or recording. This was all very helpful and
                I will no doubt use some of the applications in my future classroom.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="entry-9">
                <h3 id="title-9">07/14/2014 - Internet Awareness Presentation</h3>
                <p id="info-9"> Today the focus was the internet, or the danger which lies
                within it. This is a very interesting subject, as I have not had direct
                responsibility for a young child in contact with the internet, so I am nieve
                as to the types of difficulties one might encounter. I found the most useful
                presentation for me was the pinterest board with links to various resources
                about cyberbullying. Cyberbullying is becoming ever more prevalent, and dangerous,
                because of the technology available to the general populace. This is something
                I think everyone could use a little support in, and I'm so happy this team
                put together a collection of so many useful resources.<br><br>
                
                I think early incororaption of technology into classrooms, and continued 
                reinforcement of proper practices is the only way to deal with misuse of
                technology. Another thing to remember is that we have practices to deal with
                bullying, and it still happens. It's something that will always happyen. So
                instead of going in with the mindset that it's something to eradicate, we need
                to go in with the mindset that it will always be there and how do we minimize it.
                I think the laws the government has put into place are going to help a lot, but
                what is going to change things is a more proactive approach to technology 
                orientation within schools. If students don't know how to use it properly, then
                we aren't doing our jobs correctly. Obviously there will be some external cases,
                and that's why there are laws.</p>

        <div class="entry-10">
                <h3 id="title-10">07/15/2014 - Outstanding Technology Presentation</h3>
                <p id="info-10"> Today my group, as well as two other presented. We presented
                interactive technologies, with the idea being the use of technology which
                provides immediate feedback upon interacting with it. We really wanted to
                emphasize the integration of technology, and how you might incorporate these
                in to your own lesson plans.<br><br>
