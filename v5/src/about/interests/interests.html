                  There is a lot I like to do to help unwind when I have some free time. 
                  Traveling has been a love of mine since I was young. Having the opportunity
                  to see different cultures and places of the world is the greatest
                  privilege you have. Along with programming I also happen to be a giant geek! I'm
                  obsessed with everything to do with the universe and haven't missed a SpaceX
                  launch since the DISCOVR satellite. From Mythbusters to Marvel there's always
                  a new TV series to keep up with. <br><br>

                  I've loved video games since I was a kid and any game I've ever built has been
                  inspired from my favorites. Aside from consoles and PCs, I'm also a huge fan
                  of Magic the Gathering. This was one of the first games I ever got in to, and
                  to this day I'm still baffled by the complex scenarios the game can generate.
