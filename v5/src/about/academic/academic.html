               <p class="about-academic-description">
                  The entirety of my educational career took place at Acadia University in Wolfville Nova Scotia. I completed my first degree in Physics and Computer Science, and my second degree in Education. While attending school I ran labs, tutored, trained aquatic staff, and was a resident assistant responsible for the program planning and safety of a residence building. <br><br>

                  I started my undergraduate experience in physics but quickly realized that computer science was something I couldn't live without. During my degree I completed courses in Java, C, shell scripting, software engineering and design, data structres, computer hardware and architecture, translators, systems analysis and design, and data communication.
