                     I began working as a swim instructor and eventually started to work as a lifeguard.
                     Within a year I was employed as a beach lifeguard. The year
                     after I was promoted to beach captain, and three years after that I was an aquatic
                     coordinator. In this position I managed all 24 beaches in Halifax in cooperation with
                     three other coordinators. I've trained hundreds of lifesaving staff as well as 
                     professionals outside of the aquatics field.

                     When I first arrived at Acadia University I immediately was drawn to
                     the idea of the resident assistant position. It was a way to get involved
                     and also make a difference in the lives of other students. In this position
                     I worked on a team of eleven other RAs, and was responsible for the twenty
                     students on my floor. Throughout the year I had two jobs: one as a student,
                     and one as a Resident Assistant. The job required incredible time management
                     as we were responsible for meeting programming requirements, and regular duty
                     ensuring the building was safe.

                     The first year I was at Acadia I started to tutor high school students. This
                     was the beginning of my current career in education.
                     In later years I tutored students from first year to third year in computer
                     science and physics. I also took on Teaching Assistant roles in the Physcics
                     and Computer Science department. Near graduation I decided to continue these
                     roles in a larger sense and I applied to the education program at Acadia.
                     <br><br>

                     I completed the accelerated program at Acadia and began working as a secondary
                     teacher a year later. Within three months I had attained my first full time
                     position teaching Mathematics 7 and Mathematics 8 at Harold T. Barrett Junior
                     High. It was in this position that I began to grow quickly as a professional.
                     During this time I presented at the HRSB Innovation's in Teaching Conference on
                     digital assessment and creative engagement in the classroom. Our school also
                     led the board in initiatives like the Maker Spaces, and the Restorative Approach.

                     Around the time I graduated education from Acadia I also began to seek
                     work and projects in the web development field. Throughout both my degrees I
                     continually worked on building a strong computer science background
                     and integrating it with my other interests and disciplines. My first
                     commit on GitHub was July of 2015, and since then I've developed and
                     contributed to multiple open source projects.
                     <br><br>

                     I've worked on a number of projects which have already been outlined,
                     and explained in greater detail. Others I haven't written about as much
                     have been a lot of my personal projects like this site, a mural generator
                     application, and a number of other unfinished pieces. I'm excited to continually build on larger
                     and larger projects. For a specific layout of skills and technologies
                     I'm familiar with, go to the portfolio section of my website.
