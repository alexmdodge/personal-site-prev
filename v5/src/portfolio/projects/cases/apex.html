               <p class="cases-description">
                 I was approached by Donald and Stuart Tabor who were looking
                 to get a website up and running for their online coaching and
                 nutrition business as soon as possible. With an upcoming
                 national competition only a week away they wanted to try to
                 get something up to share around and generate interest. With
                 only four days it was going to be a push to get things working
                 in time, to the level required.

                  We immediately needed to define the aspects of the site, then get into the designs and prototyping. Using a Bootstrap framework made it easy to get initial designs over to the client and from there get the first stage finished. Using jQuery, some simple styling, a one page design was quickly constructed. The most important aspect was the collaboration throughout the project. We met nearly every day and validated every component as rapidly as possible throughout the execution.

                  At the end of four days Apex Training Systems had a professional, fully responsive, one page site. The client was happy to be able to demonstrate their business to prospective clients, and it put them one step ahead in their competitive field.

                 In the fall of last year I was having a conversation with the department head of
                 technology at Halifax West High School. Every year the guidance department sends
                 out surveys to determine what scholarships and awards, as well as other post-secondary
                 options students have persued. The trouble was this information had to be sorted, so they
                 moved to google forms. They liked having the ability to access the google sheets but
                 sorting the information became tedious. He asked me if I would be interested in building
                 an interface that used the information from Google sheets and sorted it to a more organized
                 view screen

                  The first step was getting aquainted with the Google Visualization API which lets you
                  talk to Google sheets kind of like a database. From there an interface was outlined which
                  would allow staff to search by student name, scholarship amount, and previous schools.
                  It would then retrieve the information from the sheet and output the results to a
                  formatted section. The application was also secured using a login system to ensure that
                  no student information could be retrieved except by those authorized staff.

                  The application was finished and we are still in the process on conferring with the
                  guidance department to put on some finishing touches. Already they have said that it
                  significantly decreased the time spent sifting information and will help them to add
                  additional features to the awards process.

               <p class="cases-description">
                 I have always had a love of games, and having an opportunity to build them
                 is certainly no exception to that passion. While playing around with a number of frameworks
                 I came across the Phaser framework. I've always had an interest in challenging puzzle games
                 and decided to see if I could build something of my own. <br><br>

                 Grid Grind is a puzzle challenge which randomly generates groups of blocks. Each level
                 you move further increases the number of blocks and also the challenge of collecting enough points to move on. It is kind of like chess in the sense that you have to think ahead in your moves to ensure you don't accidentally miss out on a big chain of blocks. The longer the chain the more points you get. <br><br>

                 In the future I plan on creating power ups and other incentives which you can spend your
                 points on. I also have someone working on some audio for the game to bring it to the
                 next level.
