                     I've learned a lot over the past year, and this site is a culmination of that. I've incorporated a number of new technologies, strategies, and methods to bring this application to where it needs to be. I've noticed that like most professions you need a certain level of proficiency in order to access resources and really understand how to do something. Coming from an education background, and considering how many in the software development industry rely on self-teaching to accomplish tasks, I think we could do a better job at including a broader overview of some higher level technologies.
