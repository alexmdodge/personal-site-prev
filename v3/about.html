			<h2 class="heading"> The Passion </h2>
          	<p class="intro-text">
          		There are two things that I love doing, and they are <b>teaching</b> and <b>coding</b>. 
               I hope that one day I have a job in which I can do both. I would say
               that I love web development the most, but to be honest, it is all incredible fun. I have
               taken many of my experiences from teaching and applied it to a program, as well as an
               important technique or strategy from the programming education. Really it is all related,
               learning and doing are interconnected across every skill and discipline. I take this quite
               seriously in whatever capacity I'm working, as it makes you a better person to consider
               every possible perspective.
          	</p>

			<h2 class="heading"> The Start </h2>
			<p class="intro-text">
          		I attended Acadia University for my undergraduate degree, and
          		finished with a double major in physics and computer science.
          		Typically the field path for either of these degrees is to take
          		an honours option, and then continue to a masters degree. When pondering
              my decision I panicked because I didn't know what to choose. How could I pick
              one field? I just loved it all too much. That's when it started to
          		dawn on me that there was so much to learn, and that I never wanted to
          		stop. I wanted to <b>share</b>, I wanted to <b>explore</b>, I wanted to <b>develop</b>
               , and I wanted to <b>teach</b>.

			<h2 class="heading"> Philosophy </h2>
            <p class="outro-text">
               Everyone needs a <b>philosophy</b>. There are philosophies for everything, but in order
               to be engaged and successful in the path you've chosen you need a philosophy. Some
               time ago, when deciding what I wanted to do, I worried that I was diversifying too
               much, and that within my discipline I wasn't focusing enough on one topic. I came
               across the quote below this section. This has become my mantra, and something which
               I apply to both my teaching and programming practices.<br><br>

               In programming a new framework, standard, or tool comes out every week. You need to
               be constantly learning, adapting, and applying these new developments or you get left
               behind. This is what I love about this field, it is a constant learning process, and if
               the process feels stagnant, then something is wrong.<br><br>

               In my teaching practice I live by this, and encourage my students to do the same. Plato
               and Socrates believed in learning for the sake of learning to enrich your life. While
               some of their other practices may seem archaic, I think this primary ideology is fundamental in
               education. You always get the question, <b>"Why are we learning this?"</b>. My response to this
               question is to ask students what they'll be doing four months next Tuesday at 3:10 PM? Obviously
               they don't know, nobody really knows. We learn because it enriches our lives and prepares us
               for the unknown. It allows us to be adaptable, to think critically, and to be well informed
               about the world we live in.
